Version 1.1 introduces an offline job manager.  This is required to control
analyses that take a long time for which it is inappropriate to require the
browser remains connected.  When upgrading to version 1.1, you will need to
do the following:

1) Create new bigsdb_jobs database using jobs.sql found in the sql directory
2) Create new bigsdb UNIX user, e.g.

   sudo useradd -s /bin/sh bigsdb
   
3) Create new bigsdb Postgres user, e.g.
 	
 	as postgres
 	createuser bigsdb (no need to set specific roles)

4) Create empty bigsdb_jobs.log file in the /var/log directory, make this owned
   by bigsdb, e.g.
   
   sudo touch /var/log/bigsdb_jobs.log
   sudo chown bigsdb:bigsdb /var/log/bigsdb_jobs.log

5) Copy the job_logging.conf file from the conf directory to /etc/bigsdb.
6) Update the /etc/bigsdb/bigsdb.conf file with the following (top section):
   
   jobs_db=bigsdb_jobs
