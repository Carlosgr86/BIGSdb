Upgrading BIGSdb versions
-------------------------
Occasionally a version upgrade may require a small change to the underlying
database structure.  These changes will be noted here and a SQL script to 
perform the change included.

To run the script 'script.sql' against database 'dbase', as the postgres user
type:

psql -f script.sql dbase

Version 1.2
-----------
This introduces the concept of defining an isolate database locus by its
context.  Here we can filter the genome to products of an in silico PCR
reaction or to regions within a defined distance of a matching probe.  Four
new tables are created:

pcr: describes the PCR conditions: primers sequences, allowed priming 
  mismatches and min/max product length
pcr_locus: links loci to any number of PCR reactions.  
probes: describes a nucleotide probe
probe_locus: links loci to a nucleotide probe and describes hybridization 
  thresholds.
Finally a modification of the loci table sets boolean flags to state whether
tag scanning of the locus should be limited only to the seqbin regions 
amplified by the simulated PCR reactions or to within the specified distance
of the probe sequence.
