Upgrading BIGSdb versions
-------------------------
Occasionally a version upgrade may require a small change to the underlying
database structure.  These changes will be noted here and a SQL script to 
perform the change included.

To run the script 'script.sql' against database 'dbase', as the postgres user
type:

psql -f script.sql dbase

Version 1.2
-----------
This introduces the concept of defining an isolate database locus by its
context.  Here we can filter the genome to products of an in silico PCR
reaction.  Two new tables are created, one to describe the PCR conditions:
primers sequences, allowed priming mismatches and min/max product length; the
other links loci to any number of PCR reactions.  Finally a modification of
the loci table sets a boolean flag to state whether tag scanning of the locus
should be limited only to the seqbin regions amplified by the simulated PCR
reactions.
