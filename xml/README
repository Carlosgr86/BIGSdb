This directory contains example XML database description files.  Replace
'DATABASE_NAME' with the name your database is called on your system. The
file should be renamed to config.xml and placed in a subdirectory of the 
/etc/bigsdb/dbases directory, with the subdirectory named how you would
like to call the database within a web url, e.g.

put configuration file in /etc/bigsdb/dbases/test_db for access from
http://your_website/cgi-bin/bigsdb/bigsdb.pl?db=test_db.

The isolates_config.xml file contains the minimum required isolate table
fields and matches the isolate table that will be generated using the
isolatedb.sql SQL script.  Add any other fields that you would like to both
this XML file and to the database table itself.  The XML description and the
physical structure of the database table must be kept in sync. The fields
will be ordered within the website as they appear in the XML description -
this can be different from the order that they appear within the database
table.
