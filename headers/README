This folder contains sample HTML headers for use with databases.
The standard interface includes the contents of the header.html at the top
of the page and the footer.html at the bottom.  Use this to customise the
look of the website to your needs.  Correspondingly, the curate_footer.html
and curate_header.html files are used in the same way in the curation interface.
These files should be placed in the database configuration directory, e.g.
/etc/bigsdb/dbases/DBASE_NAME along with the config.xml file.

Alternatively you can put the header files in the web site root directory for
site-wide templates.

You can also put header.html, curate_header.html, footer.html and 
curate_footer.html files in the configuration directory (/etc/bigsdb) for use
as installation-wide templates. These will be used if database-specific files 
are not present.
