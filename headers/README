This folder contains sample HTML headers for use with an isolate database.
The standard interface includes the contents of the header.html at the top
of the page and the header.html at the bottom.  Use this to customise the
look of the website to your needs.  Correspondingly, the curate_footer.html
and curate_header.html files are used in the same way in the curation interface.
These files should be placed in the database configuration directory, e.g.
/etc/bigsdb/dbases/DBASE_NAME along with the config.xml file.
